 RBL Extension for Anything
 T. Tornevall 2008-01-30 [thorne@tornevall.net]

 This extension adds RBL Checking on any webpage you want to use it on.
 Some of the source has been borrowed from a local script engine. This one: http://www.tornevall.net/engine/

 Databases needed by this script is rbl_cache (blacklisted cache) and rbl_config (used just to be sure that
 the database really was created). If everything works as it should, the tables will be created automatically.
 If not, look below, to see what to create. If you need to change something, you may do it there.

 Usage:

	Copy rbl.php and rblconfig.php to a directory you want to use it in.
	Edit rblconfig.php
	Edit a file of your choice and add

		define('RBL_DIRECTORY', '/root/web/directory/or/wherever/you/put/this');  // Do not add trailing slashes here
		require_once(RBL_DIRECTORY . '/rbl.php');

	Edit the template, blacklisted.html, to show a message to blacklisted users.

	***

	The writer of this script will not be held responsible for any damage it
	may cause to your site.

	On emergencies, look at the rblconfig.php and change this line:

		define('RBL_ENABLE', true);

	to this

		define('RBL_ENABLE', false);

	Only contact the author of this script if you want to say anything that
	makes sense. Like bugs or other IMPORTANT things.
	Example of unimportant things is: "You suck", "Remove me from your damn list" or "Remove your fucking script!"

	In short: Read the rules and disclaimer below.


 ==== RULES, DISCLAIMER AND TERMS OF USAGE ====

	- Modifications and bugfixes

		Use this script. Modify it. But if you find bugs, things that should be changed,
		etc, feel free to contact me, so I can add your wishes to the official version.

				Thanks!

	- Translation and understanding of this README?

		Do it yourself. If you don't understand english, ask someone who does.

	- Feel free to NOT send complaints about this script

		It has been written, it works, and that annoys some people out there.
		I don't care. Admins may use it or not. That is not my problem.

	- IP-Removal

		You should consider NOT to contact me about anything regarding IP-removal.
		The script still works, and it is based on databases on the Big Internet, that is
		not stored locally by me. If you are blacklisted, it's not my fault - it's
		probably someone elses problem. And I don't care.

	- Questions

		If you have ANY questions, go to http://dnsbl.tornevall.org/, RTFM and get yourself helped
		from there. I am not mean, but still - on complaints, it's not me you should
		talk with!

	- Feedback

		Coming Soon!
