New ducati site installation and migration
==================================================

Required permissions:
------------------------
1.	Read/write access to a database with creating new database perms 
2.	IMPORTANT: database user we use in new application should have access to old database too! 
	Could be old user or new one with granted permissions.
3.	PHP conf access (for creating new, temporary domain - recommended)
4.	File read/write access for application directory, via ssh or sftp/ftp
5.	PHP 5.3 is recommended.
	PHP's variable register_globals is required to be off.
	PHP's variable magic_quotes_gpc is required to be off, see also
		http://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.magic-quotes-gpc

Installation steps:
-------------------
1.	Prepare a database backup for current site (just in case)
2.	Create new database for new site (using ducati-CMS_structure.sql file)
3.	Create new location on server for new application  
4.	Set new domain for new site (i.e. league2.bzflag.net)
5.	Upload application files into new location
6.	Update configuration files: 
		/CMS/siteoptions.php
		/CMS/siteoptions_path.php
7.	Run webleague-importer.php
8.	Run bbcode-library-updater.php
9.	Delete webleague-importer.php
10.	Delete bbcode-library-updater.php 
11. Check if site works :)
12. Check if servertracker in background works
	There is a command: exec('php ' . dirname(__FILE__) . '/cli/servertracker_query_backend.php >/dev/null &');
	It will not work if php alias is not set. 
	
	
Troubleshooting:
----------------

Hard to predict what will fail, so also hard to predict what to do :) 
But be sure error logs are set and accessible.
