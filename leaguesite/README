Installing
====================================

Installing is not easy. It is recommended you have basic PHP knowledge before proceeding.

First of all PHP 5.3 is recommended.
PHP's variable register_globals is required to be off.
PHP's variable magic_quotes_gpc is required to be off, see also
	http://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.magic-quotes-gpc

You need to set up two configuration files
	CMS/siteoptions_path.php: file that shows the code where the actual config resides.
				  A template is available at CMS/siteoptions_path_example.php
	siteoptions.php: The actual config. This file should not reside in the webserver dir.
			 Also it is required to be readable by PHP.
			 A template is at CMS/siteoptions_example.php

You may use the examples to modify them. :)
	cp siteoptions_path_example.php siteoptions_path.php
Note that in this example commands it is assumed you would use the default path in siteoptions_path.php
	cp siteoptions_example.php ../../siteoptions.php

Now you need to set up the relational database management system.
At the moment only using mysql is possible.

A database structure dump can be found in ts-CMS_structure.sql within this directory.
To avoid concurrent access and performance issues it is recommended to use a database only for this league software.

It is highly recommended to use a BBCode library. See the CMS/nbbc-wrapper.php example file.

Updates
-----------

By using svn up you should get a new version of the source code, if available.
However the database structure may has changed. It is planned to provide an updater between major stable versions.

If you upgrade your BBCode library it is recommended to run the bbcode-library-updater.php (requires the website to be in the web dir) but keep in mind
this will break legacy data in the database.
